New features:

v0.14     1997.12.16
    Added ChopBlanks test to t/dbi.t
    Ulrich Pfeifer found (and fixed) yet another memory leak in bind_params.
    Reworked the code so that it also works on machines wheres ints are
    not 4 bytes long.
    Truncated some long lines (so they fit in an 80 char windows).
    Documented lack of procedure call.
    Fixed the VMS build problem - nobody needed it. Am I the only one that
    uses Ingres, Perl and VMS??

v0.13     1997.11.28
    Found (one of the) AutoCommit bug(s)! Needs an update to DBI to work
    properly. (Autocommit state is not initialized).
    Fixed serious memory leak in binding core (Thanks to Ulrich Pfeifer).

BEFORE BUILDING, TESTING AND INSTALLING this you will need to:

    Build, test and install Perl 5.004 (or newer)
    It is very important to test it and install it!

    Build, test and install the DBI module.
    It is very important to test it and install it!
    *** DBI must be at least version 0.91 ***

BUILDING

    If Perl5 is installed do:

	perl Makefile.PL

    If Perl5 is NOT installed install it, and come back here later!

    Then do:

	make
	make test
	make install

    HP-UX users (and others) will have to build perl with static
    extensions:
        make perl
        make test
        make inst_perl
    See the MakeMaker docs for further: perldoc ExtUtils::MakeMaker

The make test pass will ask for at databasename (if not given in one of
the DBI environment variable (see DBI.pm for particulars). It will then
create a table named 'testhththt' in this database, manipulate it and
delete it again.
It is important for the succes of the test that you have the neccesary
Ingres permissions.

The ingtest.pl script is a "quick" hack of the test for ingperl (the
"old" perl4 interface).

If it fails horribly, see below.

Do NOT hand edit the generated Makefile unless you are completely sure
you understand the implications! Always try to make changes via the
Makefile.PL command line and/or editing the Makefile.PL.

You should never need to make any changes. If you do *please* let me
know so that I can try to make it automatic in a later release.

KNOWN PROBLEMS:

        o the arguments to &sql(connect) must be given in the order:
            database-name username other-options
          otherwise the check for username wil fail.

TO DO LIST:

        o Add support for OpenIngres long datatypes.
        o Make cursors updateable.
        o Add a way to call database procedures.

IF YOU HAVE PROBLEMS:

Firstly, check the Frequently Asked Questions, Known Bugs and any other
pertinent documents at:

	http://www.hermetica.com/technologia/DBI

If this does *not* resolve your problem, please post details to 
dbi-user@fugue.com and CC them to me at ht@datani.dk.  
Please include:

1. A complete log of a complete build, e.g.:

	perl Makefile.PL -v           (do a make realclean first)
	make
	make test
	DBI_TRACE=3 make test

2. Full details of which version of Ingres/esql and Perl you're using.

3. The output of:
	perl -e 'use Config; print Config::myconfig()'

4. If you get a core dump, try to include a stack trace from it.
   If the stack trace mentions XS_DynaLoader_dl_load_file then rerun
   make test after setting the environment variable PERL_DL_DEBUG to 2.
   Similarly, get the Devel::CoreStack module and use it.

5. Please don't post problems to comp.lang.perl.misc or perl5-porters.
