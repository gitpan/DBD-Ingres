------------------IMPORTANT WARNING-----------------------------

THIS IS ALPHA SOFTWARE!!!!

I have built this on:
  DEC AXP using Ingres 6.4/05 (axp.osf/02) and Digital UNIX v3.2
  DEC AXP using Ingres 6.4/05 (axp.vms/03) and OpenVMS V6.2-1H3.
It has been built and tested on
  SunOS 4.1.3 (OpenIngres 1.1) and
  Solaris 2.5 (OpenIngres 1.2) by  Kraemer <szrzs069@sysadm.rz.uni-kiel.de>
  HP-UX 9 (Ingres 6.4) by Gil Hirsch <gilh@cpm.telrad.co.il>
     (HP-UX 9 needs static linking, the Makefile.PL has been modified to
     handle this).

I will with pleasure accept patches and/or recommendations for improvements.
My workload prevents me from giving this too much time - so have patience....

See CHANGES for an overview of the changes since last release.

DBD::Ingres --  an Ingres interface for Perl 5 using DBI.

   Copyright (c) 1996  Henrik Tougaard

   You may distribute under the terms of either the GNU General Public
   License or the Artistic License, as specified in the Perl README file.

WARNING: THIS IS ALPHA SOFTWARE. IT IS POSSIBLY UNRELIABLE!

BEFORE BUILDING, TESTING AND INSTALLING this you will need to:

    Build, test and install Perl 5.
    It is very important to test it and install it!

*** NOTE: *** perl5 MUST BE INSTALLED TO VERSION 5.003 AT LEAST! ***

    Build, test and install the DBI module.
    It is very important to test it and install it!

BUILDING

    If Perl5 is installed do:

	perl Makefile.PL

    If Perl5 is NOT installed install it, and come back here later!

    Then do:

	make perl
	make
	make test
	make install

(For the test: set the environment variable DBI_DBNAME to the name
of the database that you want to use. The test will create a table
named 'testhththt', add some data to it and delete the table again.
If you want a verbose print from the test: edit test.pl and set
$verbose to 1)

The ingtest.pl script is a "quick" hack of the test for ingperl (the
"old" perl4 interface).

If it fails horribly, see below.

Do NOT hand edit the generated Makefile unless you are completely sure
you understand the implications! Always try to make changes via the
Makefile.PL command line and/or editing the Makefile.PL.

You should never need to make any changes. If you do *please* let me
know so that I can try to make it automatic in a later release.

KNOWN PROBLEMS:

        o the arguments to &sql(connect) must be given in the order:
            database-name username other-options
          otherwise the check for username wil fail.

	o DBD::st:rows and DBD::db::rows do not change session. This will
          cause errors if you have more than 1 connected session and
          use the other session between an execute and the correspondings
	  call of rows. Eg:
		$dbh1->do("update ...");
		$dbh2->do("delete...");
		$rows = $dbh1->rows;   # <- this will return $dbh2->rows
	  I'll fix it someday.....

TO DO LIST:

        o Add support for OpenIngres 1.2
            blobs  etc.


IF YOU HAVE PROBLEMS:

Firstly, check the Frequently Asked Questions, Known Bugs and any other
pertinent documents at:

	http://www.hermetica.com/technologia/DBI

If this does *not* resolve your problem, please post details to 
dbi-user@fugue.com and CC them to me at ht@datani.dk.  
Please include:

1. A complete log of a complete build, e.g.:

	perl Makefile.PL           (do a make realclean first)
	make
	make test
	PERL_DBI_DEBUG=3 make test

2. Full details of which version of Ingres/esql and Perl you're using.

3. The output of:
	perl -e 'use Config; print Config::myconfig()'

4. If you get a core dump, try to include a stack trace from it.
   If the stack trace mentions XS_DynaLoader_dl_load_file then rerun
   make test after setting the environment variable PERL_DL_DEBUG to 2.
   Similarly, get the Devel::CoreStack module and use it.

5. Please don't post problems to comp.lang.perl.misc or perl5-porters.
