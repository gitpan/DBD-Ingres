------------------IMPORTANT WARNING-----------------------------

THIS IS PRE-ALPHA SOFTWARE!!!!

You *WILL* encounter problems!

If you are not confident that you can debug this software - ie. find and
patch all problems - then wait and come back for a later release.

This release passes the make test stage and is in *NO* way ready
for production.

************************
*                      *
* YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED *
*                      *
************************


I have built this on:
  DEC AXP using Ingres 6.4/05 (axp.osf/02) and Digital UNIX v3.2
  DEC AXP using Ingres 6.4/05 (axp.vms/03) and OpenVMS V6.2-1H3.

No other ports have been attempted (I don't have access to Ingres on other
platforms..)

I will with pleasure accept patches and/or recommendations for improvements.
My workload prevents me from giving this too much time - so have patience....

This release is for debugging only!!!!

Release 0.01 was an internal test-release that never made it out to the
general public, release 0.02 is deemed stable enough to allow brave souls
to test it   ;-}

DBD::Ingres --  an Ingres interface for Perl 5 using DBI.

   Copyright (c) 1996  Henrik Tougaard

   You may distribute under the terms of either the GNU General Public
   License or the Artistic License, as specified in the Perl README file.

WARNING: THIS IS ALPHA SOFTWARE. IT IS POSSIBLY UNRELIABLE!

BEFORE BUILDING, TESTING AND INSTALLING this you will need to:

    Build, test and install Perl 5.
    It is very important to test it and install it!

*** NOTE: *** perl5 MUST BE INSTALLED TO VERSION 5.003 AT LEAST! ***

    Build, test and install the DBI module.
    It is very important to test it and install it!

BUILDING

    If Perl5 is installed do:

	perl Makefile.PL

    If Perl5 is NOT installed install it, and come back here later!

    Then do:

	make perl
	make
	make test
	make install

If it fails horribly, see below.

Do NOT hand edit the generated Makefile unless you are completely sure
you understand the implications! Always try to make changes via the
Makefile.PL command line and/or editing the Makefile.PL.

The VMS port has uncovered an error in VMS-MakeMaker:
   In the decsrip.mms file change "[.2]" to "Ingres.obj dbdimp.obj"
   two places until the makemaker is fixed - I use MakeMaker (v5.38)
You WILL have to hand edit the descrip.mms file!!!!

You should never need to make any changes. If you do *please* let me
know so that I can try to make it automatic in a later release.

KNOWN PROBLEMS:

        o the arguments to &sql(connect) must be given in the order:
            database-name username other-options
          otherwise the check for username wil fail.

	o Many other - this will fail miserably in unpredictable ways!!


TO DO LIST:

	o Extend the DBD, so that more than one connection to the database
	  is possible.

        o Add support for OpenIngres 1.2
            blobs, dynamic link, etc.

Firstly, check the Frequently Asked Questions, Known Bugs and any other
pertinent documents at:

	http://www.hermetica.com/technologia/DBI

If this does *not* resolve your problem, please post details to 
dbi-user@fugue.com and CC them to me at ht@datani.dk.  
Please include:

1. A complete log of a complete build, e.g.:

	perl Makefile.PL           (do a make realclean first)
	make
	make test
	PERL_DBI_DEBUG=3 make test

2. Full details of which version of Ingres/esql and Perl you're using.

3. The output of:
	perl -e 'use Config; print Config::myconfig()'

4. If you get a core dump, try to include a stack trace from it.
   If the stack trace mentions XS_DynaLoader_dl_load_file then rerun
   make test after setting the environment variable PERL_DL_DEBUG to 2.
   Similarly, get the Devel::CoreStack module and use it.

5. Please don't post problems to comp.lang.perl.misc or perl5-porters.
