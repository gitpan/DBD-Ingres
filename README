DBD::Ingres --  an Ingres interface for Perl 5 using DBI.

   Copyright (c) 1996  Henrik Tougaard

   You may distribute under the terms of either the GNU General Public
   License or the Artistic License, as specified in the Perl README file.

BEFORE BUILDING, TESTING AND INSTALLING this you will need to:

    Build, test and install Perl 5.
    It is very important to test it and install it!

*** NOTE: *** perl5 MUST BE INSTALLED TO VERSION 5.004 AT LEAST! ***

    Build, test and install the DBI module.
    It is very important to test it and install it!
    *** DBI must be at least version 0.89 ***

BUILDING

    If Perl5 is installed do:

	perl Makefile.PL

    If Perl5 is NOT installed install it, and come back here later!

    Then do:

	make
	make test
	make install

(For the test: set the environment variable DBI_DBNAME to the name
of the database that you want to use. The test will create a table
named 'testhththt', add some data to it and delete the table again.
If you want a verbose print from the test: edit test.pl and set
$verbose to 1)

The ingtest.pl script is a "quick" hack of the test for ingperl (the
"old" perl4 interface).

If it fails horribly, see below.

Do NOT hand edit the generated Makefile unless you are completely sure
you understand the implications! Always try to make changes via the
Makefile.PL command line and/or editing the Makefile.PL.

You should never need to make any changes. If you do *please* let me
know so that I can try to make it automatic in a later release.

KNOWN PROBLEMS:

        o the arguments to &sql(connect) must be given in the order:
            database-name username other-options
          otherwise the check for username wil fail.

	o DBD::st:rows and DBD::db::rows do not change session. This will
          cause errors if you have more than 1 connected session and
          use the other session between an execute and the correspondings
	  call of rows. Eg:
		$dbh1->do("update ...");
		$dbh2->do("delete...");
		$rows = $dbh1->rows;   # <- this will return $dbh2->rows
	  I'll fix it someday.....

TO DO LIST:

        o Add support for OpenIngres 1.2: blobs  etc.


RECENT CHANGES:
v0.05_92  1997.09.12 (early morning)
    Ulrich Pfeifer <Ulrich.Pfeifer@de.uu.net> has come up with a solution to my
    Makefile.PL problems with 'old' Ingres-versions. Thanks.
    Ifdef'fed around Ingres6.4 (and earlier) non-awareness of DBMS_PASSWORD
    $dbh->rows works again.
    This version builds and tests cleanly for me.

v0.05_91  1997.09.11
    I just got the binding to work. I hope :)
    Now only $dbh->rows is mucked up.

v0.05_90  1997.09.10
    Major rehaul
    - added bind params - NOTE It doesn't work yet
    - added password support
    - HPUX must link statically
    - RCS Revision bumped to 2.100 so CPAN can find its way around
    - tried to adjust to the DBI-spec (as pr. DBI-0.90) with all Tim's new
      ideas
    - expanded pod
    This is released as a "release early and often" version - respects to Eric
    S. Raymond - for the not faint at heart.


IF YOU HAVE PROBLEMS:

Firstly, check the Frequently Asked Questions, Known Bugs and any other
pertinent documents at:

	http://www.hermetica.com/technologia/DBI

If this does *not* resolve your problem, please post details to 
dbi-user@fugue.com and CC them to me at ht@datani.dk.  
Please include:

1. A complete log of a complete build, e.g.:

	perl Makefile.PL -v           (do a make realclean first)
	make
	make test
	DBI_TRACE=3 make test

2. Full details of which version of Ingres/esql and Perl you're using.

3. The output of:
	perl -e 'use Config; print Config::myconfig()'

4. If you get a core dump, try to include a stack trace from it.
   If the stack trace mentions XS_DynaLoader_dl_load_file then rerun
   make test after setting the environment variable PERL_DL_DEBUG to 2.
   Similarly, get the Devel::CoreStack module and use it.

5. Please don't post problems to comp.lang.perl.misc or perl5-porters.
