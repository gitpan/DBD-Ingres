V0.05	1997.03.20
	Makefile.PL changed so that it can link OpenIngres.
	Support for HP-UX added (thanks to Gil Hirsch <gilh@cpm.telrad.co.il>
	and Tim Bunce <Tim.Bunce@ig.co.uk>)
	Added support for DBI 0.77
	
V0.04	1997.01.17
	The function DBD::Ingres::st:fetch has now been reinstated
	(thanks to Tim Bunce <Tim.Bunce@ig.co.uk> who showed the way to
	let case insentive linker handle case sensitivity)

V0.03	1997.01.09
	Restriction on number of simultaniously open cursors removed
	 - inspiration from Dirk Kraemer (kraemer@rz.uni-kiel.de)

	Multiple database connects possible

	Must reuse statement numbers as the number of different
	statement names between commits is limited by the available
	parser memory. You get error:
		E_PS0F02_MEMORY_FULL
		  There is no more available memory. Try again later.
	when this happens.

	DBD::rows does not change the session - will have to discover
	whether this is a dbh or a sth to get the session number.
	Tried (unsuccessfully) to use $dbh->{Database} in Ingres.pm
	- any better ideas?

V0.0201  1996.12.18
	Can now link dynamically on Unix
	 - thanks to Paul Lindner <lindner@itu.int>

	Solaris fixes to Makefile.PL
	 - thanks to Dirk Kraemer (kraemer@rz.uni-kiel.de)

	The bug in VMS MakeMaker has been fixed - require a
	version that includes the fix!
	Still need to improve the ingres.opt handling.
