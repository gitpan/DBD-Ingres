v0.05_92  1997.09.12 (early morning)
    Ulrich Pfeifer <Ulrich.Pfeifer@de.uu.net> has come up with a solution to my
    Makefile.PL problems with 'old' Ingres-versions. Thanks.
    Ifdef'fed around Ingres6.4 (and earlier) non-awareness of DBMS_PASSWORD
    $dbh->rows works again.
    This version builds and tests cleanly for me.

v0.05_91  1997.09.11
    I just got the binding to work. I hope :)
    Now only $dbh->rows is mucked up.

v0.05_90  1997.09.10
    Major rehaul
    - added bind params - NOTE It doesn't work yet
    - added password support
    - HPUX must link statically
    - RCS Revision bumped to 2.100 so CPAN can find its way around
    - tried to adjust to the DBI-spec (as pr. DBI-0.90) with all Tim's new
      ideas
    - expanded pod
    This is released as a "release early and often" version - respects to Eric
    S. Raymond - for the not faint at heart.

V0.0504   1997.06.16
    Dropped { ing_trim_blanks } again as Tim Bunce has added it to DBI.
    Now needs  DBI-0.82. (for this reason)
    Expanded the pod (and adjusted it to reflect the new DBI-specs.
    Tried to conform better to the DBI-spec.

V0.05_03  1997.04.30
    Added attribs on connect and prepare.
       { ing_trim_blanks => 1 }
    to cause trimming of trailing blanks.
    The former change (from 0.05_01) is now reverted.

V0.05_02 1997.04.29
    No changes. Just a number change as I can't upload the d... thing to
    PAUSE.

V0.05_01 1997.04.16

    Check on II_SYSTEM moved to connect (was at compile-time).

    Improved library dectection for OpenIngres without installed ABF
    component.
    
    Improved Ingperl emulation (Ronald B. Irvin <rbirvin@usgs.gov>):
        - &sql_fetch into scalar now returns first column of output
          and warns if $sql_sth->{Warn} is true.
        - Warnings from &sql_close without open cursor are now only
          output if requested (uses $sql_sth->{Warn}).
        - &sql_eval_col1 fixed.

    Now known to work on DG-UX (Ronald B. Irvin <rbirvin@usgs.gov>).
    
    Fetch(row) truncates trailing blanks from text-columns. This feature
    can be disabled by setting $sth->{CompatMode} true. I was tired of
    writing C<VARCHAR(column)> or C<$col=~S/\+$//;> all over the place!
    WARNING: this may change old (DBD) code!!!
    Ingperl sets CompatMode so Ingperl scripts are not affected.

    Many other cleanups and buglet fixes.

V0.05	1997.03.20
	Makefile.PL changed so that it can link OpenIngres.

	Support for HP-UX added (thanks to Gil Hirsch <gilh@cpm.telrad.co.il>
	and Tim Bunce <Tim.Bunce@ig.co.uk>)

	Added support for DBI 0.77
	
V0.04	1997.01.17
	The function DBD::Ingres::st:fetch has now been reinstated
	(thanks to Tim Bunce <Tim.Bunce@ig.co.uk> who showed the way to
	let case insentive linker handle case sensitivity)

V0.03	1997.01.09
	Restriction on number of simultaniously open cursors removed
	 - inspiration from Dirk Kraemer (kraemer@rz.uni-kiel.de)

	Multiple database connects possible

	Must reuse statement numbers as the number of different
	statement names between commits is limited by the available
	parser memory. You get error:
		E_PS0F02_MEMORY_FULL
		  There is no more available memory. Try again later.
	when this happens.

	DBD::rows does not change the session - will have to discover
	whether this is a dbh or a sth to get the session number.
	Tried (unsuccessfully) to use $dbh->{Database} in Ingres.pm
	- any better ideas?

V0.0201  1996.12.18
	Can now link dynamically on Unix
	 - thanks to Paul Lindner <lindner@itu.int>

	Solaris fixes to Makefile.PL
	 - thanks to Dirk Kraemer (kraemer@rz.uni-kiel.de)

	The bug in VMS MakeMaker has been fixed - require a
	version that includes the fix!
	Still need to improve the ingres.opt handling.
